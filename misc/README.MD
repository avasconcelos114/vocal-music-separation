Miscellaneous utilities
===

This folder contains miscellaneous utilities that aren't required for the CNN, but they might be helpful anyway.

## `test_tensorflow.py`

This script lists all the devices tensorflow detects. Useful to see whether tensorflow loads, and if it does - what devices it picks up. Having GPU support helps.

## `create_spectrogram.py`

This script generates a spectrogram of an audio file. For more information run - `python create_spectrogram.py -h`.

## `create_binmask.py`

Creates a binary mask from an audio file.

## `apply_vocal_mask.py`

This script accepts a mixture and a vocal track, processes them the same way it's done when preparing data for the CNN and outputs both vocal and instrumental tracks. Can be used for comparisons.

## `cnn_output_plot.py`

Makes a mask of network outputs. Sadly Matplotlib is kind of terrible for datasets of this type, so I don't recommend using it. Accepts a file containing a numpy array of prediction values generated by running the neural net in `separate` mode with the `dump_data` argument set to `true`.
